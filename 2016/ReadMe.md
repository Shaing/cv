```Implemented 1.8" & 2.5" SSD Product lines```  
- Product engineer | 01-10  
- Pre-Software develop enginner | 10-12
### Responsibilities
- Conducted MP & RW TOOL testing and software debugging.

- Utilized software testing and debugging to analyze SSD FW behavior and provided feedback to FW-RD.

- Analyzed NAND Flash quality from a production perspective and optimized production configurations.
### Experience in the job
- Introduced a software-based approach to increase automation coverage, reducing production methods and preventing errors. Transitioned from manually established data flows to an automated system.

- Resolved compatibility issues between hardware, drivers, and FW, using cross-verification methods to converge problems and avoid combinations causing compatibility anomalies.

- Analyzed user behavior and SSD behavior patterns through production logs. Conducted Flash bad block analysis and quality assessment to eliminate redundant testing, identify data arguments, and define optimized testing processes.

- Translated production processes and experiences into code, implementing automated solutions. Integrated manual actions using code to construct processes.
